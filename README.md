[Annotation note reference](https://springframework.guru/spring-framework-annotations/)

@Configuration 

This annotation is used on classes which define beans. `@Configuration` is an analog for XML configuration file â€“ it is configuration using Java class. Java class annotated with `@Configuration` is a configuration by itself and will have methods to instantiate and configure the dependencies.

@Bean 

This annotation is used at the method level. `@Bean` annotation works with `@Configuration` to create Spring beans. As mentioned earlier, `@Configuration` will have methods to instantiate and configure dependencies. Such methods will be annotated with `@Bean`. The method annotated with this annotation works as bean ID and it creates and returns the actual bean.
